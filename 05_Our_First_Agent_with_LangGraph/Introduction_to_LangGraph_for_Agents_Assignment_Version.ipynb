        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

What is Attention in machine learning?\\nAttention is a mechanism that determines the importance of different parts of an input sequence relative to each other. Inspired by human attention, it assigns weights to different elements (like words in a sentence) to focus on the most relevant information for a given task. Attention mechanisms are widely used in natural language processing and other areas to improve model performance by allowing models to selectively concentrate on important features, thereby capturing long-term dependencies and enhancing understanding.\\n\\nWould you like more detailed explanations on any of these topics?\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 317, 'prompt_tokens': 4676, 'total_tokens': 4993, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_38343a2f8f', 'id': 'chatcmpl-BrSccnB0XTJ1nnPp7885xOwmErV2J', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--567d8598-d423-4ec6-a40b-1f3d29f9eeb8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4676, 'output_tokens': 317, 'total_tokens': 4993, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]\n",
