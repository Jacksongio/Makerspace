## Please evaluate your system on the following questions.

    - Aspect Tested: Quite informative, explains its use and strays away from more complex terms and uses simple common vocabulary, i.e. "OOP is about building your program from things that have data and behavior bundled together."
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points
    - Aspect Tested: Extremely concise, and was able to collect all important information. Nothing was left off, and basically removed all filler and turned it into a quite effective summarizer.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100-150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place
    - Aspect Tested: The story was quite imaginative, and could be mistaken for an actual human written short story. It followed the main theme about a robot finding friendship, and also aligned with the word constraint.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Extremely informative, and allowed for extremely easy explanation, after 10 different tries there was no hallucination and always arrived at the correct answer.
5. Rewrite the following pragraph in a professional, formal tone...
    - Aspect Tested: Works perfectly, nothing left out and all diction was turned to a professional tone, seemingly increasing the vocabulary of the model.
