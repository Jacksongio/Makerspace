        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
        "\n",

Lack of Clear Communication or Notices: Many borrowers reported not receiving timely, accurate, or sufficient notices about loan repayment status, due dates, or changes when loans were transferred or modified. This led to unawareness of when payments were due, resulting in missed payments and reported delinquencies.\\n\\n2. Difficulties with Payment Handling and Applying Funds: Some borrowers experienced issues with their loan servicers where extra payments were misapplied—most often to interest rather than principal—and payments were reversed or not properly processed, making repayment challenging.\\n\\n3. Multiple Transfers and Confusing Account Information: Frequent transfers between loan servicers (e.g., from Great Lakes to Nelnet to Aidvantage) often resulted in inconsistent account balances, missing or incorrect information, and inability to access or verify loan details, adding to repayment difficulties.\\n\\n4. Unfavorable Repayment Options and Lack of Support: Borrowers were sometimes steered into forbearance or deferment—options that do not reduce principal and often increase total debt due to accumulating interest. They were not always informed about income-driven repayment plans, loan forgiveness programs, or other manageable options, leading to unmanageable debt growth.\\n\\n5. Administrative Errors and Lack of Assistance: Errors such as incorrect reporting to credit bureaus, failure to notify borrowers of delinquency, or mismanagement of payments caused credit damage and discouraged repayment.\\n\\n6. Economic Hardship and Life Circumstances: Many borrowers faced financial hardships such as unemployment, health issues, homelessness, or caring for family, making their ability to repay loans impossible despite efforts.\\n\\n7. Disputes Over Loan Details and Rights Violations: Some borrowers pointed to illegal or unethical practices, such as improper transfer of loans, lack of documentation, or violations of rights under laws like FERPA, which complicated their ability to manage or contest their loans.\\n\\nIn summary, a combination of poor communication, administrative errors, mismanagement, economic hardship, and lack of transparent, supportive options contributed to the failure of many to repay their loans.'"
