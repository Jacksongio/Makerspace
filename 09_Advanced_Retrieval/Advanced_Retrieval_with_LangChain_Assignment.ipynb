        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

These factors, combined with financial hardships, stagnant wages, or job loss, contributed to their inability to meet repayment obligations.

        "Based on this evaluation of retrieval methods for loan complaint data, the best overall was Contextual Compression because it provides the highest quality results by reranking retrieved documents, worth the extra cost for production systems that require accuracy. Best for speed is BM25 because its the fastest, with no API costs, and great for exact keyword matching. BM25 is also best for budget, due to its zero API costs after initial setup. Best for recall, Multi-query because it generates multiple query variations to catch more relevant documents. My recommendation is start with BM25 for cost-effectiveness, then upgrade to Contextual Compression if quality imrpovements justify additional cost.\n"
